# Contact Manager App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.\
This is an Angular Bootstrap project for a Contact Manager app that allows you to search, add, delete, view and edit contacts. It uses json-server to mock a REST API for storing the contact data, and a search pipe to filter the contacts based on the user's input. The app also features a responsive design using Bootstrap modals.

## Development server

To run this app on your local machine, follow these steps:\

1-Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-manager.git' \
2-Install the dependencies: 'npm install'\
3-Start the json-server: 'npm start' (inside the server directory)\
4-Start the app: 'ng serve'\
The app should now be running on http://localhost:4200.

## Usage

To use the app, simply navigate to http://localhost:4200 in your web browser. You should see a list of contacts, along with a search bar at the top to filter the list. You can add a new contact by clicking the "Add" button. To delete a contact, simply click the "Delete" button next to the contact in the list. To view or edit a contact, click on their buttons.

## Build
